# @description:  9.Use lambda expressions and the filter() function to filter out words from a list that don't start
# with the letter 's'. For example: seq = ['soup','dog','salad','cat','great']
# should be filtered down to: # ['soup','salad']

seq = ["soup", "dog", "salad", "cat", "great"]
result = list(filter(lambda word: word[0] == "s", seq))
print(result)

# Output: ['soup', 'salad']
